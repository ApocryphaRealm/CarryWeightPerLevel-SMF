# CarryWeightPerLevel-SMF - changelog

Rule 61: this mod's own history, kept beside the code it describes.

> **The entries below this line were RECONSTRUCTED from `version-ledger.json` on
> 2026-08-27, not written at the time of the change.** They carry only what the ledger
> recorded - the status and the evidence - so they are thinner than a real entry and may
> be missing changes the ledger never captured. Treat them as a starting point rather
> than a record. Everything from the next version onward is written as it happens.

Each version carries its **version-ledger status**: **working** (observed in game),
**untested** (built, not confirmed), **failed** (built but broken; the number was
reclaimed), **scratch** (a hypothesis-test build that never held a real number).

<!-- VERSIONING-RULES -->
> **Versioning rules (CLAUDE.md rules 6 and 48 - identical for mods and documents):**
> * `X.Y.Z`. A change increments the THIRD number. At `.9` the MINOR rolls: `1.0.9 -> 1.1.0`;
>   `1.0.10` never exists.
> * The next number is **LAST WORKING + 1**. A failed, scratch or untested test build does NOT
>   consume its number - the next attempt at the same step REUSES it.
> * Numbers are never typed. ONE tool, `.MD\scripts\version-gate.ps1`, holds every version rule
>   and is a GATE that fails: `bump` issues the next number and writes every location, `record`
>   proves it working (evidence + the binary's hash), `gate` refuses packaging or finalizing
>   anything it did not issue. Documents go through `docs-pipeline.ps1 -Action bump` and the rules
>   through `rules-version.ps1 -Action bump`, both of which take their arithmetic from that same
>   tool. A number typed by hand is wrong until the tool agrees.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-08-27 - untested

### Fixed
- Settings saved in game were lost on reload: Save() wrote the INI with plain file I/O, but Init() and Reload() read it back through INISettingCollection::ReadFromFile, which uses the Win32 profile API that PrivateProfileRedirector hooks and caches - so a reload was served the values from game start, and the Redirector could later flush its stale cache back over the file. Settings are now parsed straight from the INI with plain file I/O and preferred over the collection, which is left holding only the compiled-in defaults; the plugin never hands its INI to the profile API in either direction, so it behaves identically with or without the Redirector installed. Same fix as Dragon's Eye Minimap 1.5.7.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-27 - untested

### Changed
- local package only - this repo has no tags at all


### Known
- LATENT BUG, verified by source inspection 2026-08-27, not yet fixed here: this mod saves its INI with plain file I/O but reads it back through INISettingCollection::ReadFromFile, which uses the Win32 profile API that PrivateProfileRedirector hooks and caches. Under the Redirector a reload is served the values from game start rather than the ones just written - settings appear to save then revert. Worse, once the plugin's INI has been read through that API the Redirector caches it and can write its stale copy back over the file on game-save or exit, losing settings between sessions. Dragon's Eye Minimap 1.5.7 fixed exactly this: prefer values parsed directly from the file in the shared Read<T> helper, and stop calling ReadFromFile so the Redirector never caches our INI at all. CustomDifficultyUI-SMF was fixed earlier and is the precedent.
